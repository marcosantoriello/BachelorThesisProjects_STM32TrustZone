# Test UART Interrupt Mode

I made this project in order to take some more confidence with the exchange of data between my PC and the Nucleo Board using USART.<br>
In particular, here I just implemented a program that, whenever a user type in some input (one char at the time), the variable
`counter` gets incremented. In order to check the value of this variable, you can debug the program and check it.
